											<h2> Overview</h2>
										</header>
										<p>Sustainable Cobourg is a For-Benefit organization based out of the town of Cobourg on a mission to increase community 
											awareness on environmental issues. By nature, the effects of climate change will be felt on a global scale, but in 
											communities like Cobourg that are in direct proximity to large bodies of water certain effects like flooding and decreased 
											water quality will be more profound.</p> 
										<p>To contribute to the effort to educate the community of Cobourg about these impacts, our 
											team has put together a community-based water mapping program. This water mapping program allows for reporting on a set of water
											 quality parameters as well as report on flooding events within their community. The collected data is presented in a Dashboard,
											  that allows interested citizens to visualize the data and a Story Map that gives further context to water quality and flooding
											   as it relates to Cobourg.</p>

										<strong>Step 1:</strong> ETL
										<!-- <p> Water quality monitoring data was extracted from the Provincial (Stream) Water Quality Network and organized 
											into one data table that was then used to create a hosted feature layer in ArcGIS Online
										</p> -->

									<li class="style2">

										<strong>Step 2:</strong> Form Creation
										<!-- <p>Two forms were created. One made exclusively for use in the field collecting water quality data, the second made for use 
										   at home or on the go for flood reporting as well as general sentiments towards water related environmental issues.

								<p class="content"><img class = "image main" src = "images/ETL.png"> ETL: Data was take from the Provincial (Stream) Water Quality Monitoring Network and brought into 
									MS Access where the relevant tables and fields within those tables were decided on. A table was designed to hold these fields 
									which were then inserted into it. Finally, this table was brough into ArcGIS Online to create a hosted feature layer</p>
								<p class="content"><img class = "image main" src = "images/formscreate.png"> Form Creation: Two surveys were created using Survey123 Connect. In this environment 
								XLS forms were configured after considering the anticipated end user as well as the type of data that was requested to be collected.</p>
								<p class="content"><img class = "image main" src = "images/luprep.png"> Map Layer Preparation Part 1: The first part of map layer preparation 
								was gathering the necessary layers to create web maps in ArcGIS Online Environment, the bulk of this was done in ArcGIS Pro. The data was clipped, 
								projected and symbolized and certain features digitzed. This also included taking raster land use data from the Souther Ontario Land Informaton Resource System)SOLRIS 
							    and converting to vector format. This data was then used to show types of land use in flood prone regions</p>
								<p class="content"><img class = "image main" src = "images/lupreppart2.png"> Map Layer Preparation Part 2: Once the hosted feature layers were brought into 
								ArcGIS Online Python API and Arcade were used to make customizations for the maps. For example customization of popups to show the weather conditions 
								during collection in certain regions or the main types of collection. ArcGIS Python was used in the Notebook environment to update the data in hosted feature 
								layers to keep data current. </p>
								<p class="content"><img class = "image main" src = "images/dashpic.png"> Dashboard: A Dashboard was created to display maps created from the prepped feature layers 
								as well as the collected survey data. The Dashboard was split into three pages as to not overwhelm the viewer. Arcade was used once again in this environment to 
							    create indicators for flooding based on weekly averages as well as to notify when certain water quality parameters were being measured
								in dangerous quantities. </p>
								<p class="content"><img class = "image main" src = "images/Smap.png"> StoryMap: Through the creation of this StoryMap Sustainable Cobourg gained a hub to host data that has been 
									collected and educate and inform their community about water quality issues. </p>
